# Athena
Athena is comming to our school ( **1337KH** ) with blessing of god.

<img src="./assets/school_of_athen.jpg">

&nbsp;

# About the project
This project is intended to start a library in 1337Kh sponsored
by students and former students or anyone who believe in our skills
and our potential.

&nbsp;

# Why?
42 network have one of the most effective cursus in the world.
the people behind it are smart people and know what they are doing.
while the cursus can teach you about some important technical areas in computer science,
I am sure that it's not enough and 42 knows that. we should learn by ourselves.

With that in mind we think that we need a library where we can discover new things,
learn more and boost our skills making 1337 proud of their students.

The companies will be glad to see a 1.5 year student with too much knowlege about software
architecture and design patterns ...
those skills that a 1337 student would normally learn in the internship.

&nbsp;

# What books
There are some highly recommended books in computer science that are going to be prioritized over other things.

&nbsp;

## **- First Principles**
